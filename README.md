* MPT1327 - Trunking system, one or many shared users using a group of frequencies. Any scanner 
          can hear and monitor these transmissions, however for busy trunk nets a trunk tracker 
          type scanner is beneficial as it can follow conversations by one certain user from one 
          frequency to another instead of relying on your scanner to pick out channels at random.




# How do I search the directory?

* This directory is a standard text file which can be opened in NOTEPAD. In notepad click on EDIT 
and then click FIND. Type in what you are looking for, click FIND NEXT to move on to the next entry. 
Remember to be wise with keywords, for example if looking for a Bus service in Stockport try all 
connecting areas as listings are made different and  some services are regional, so if your searching 
for something in STOCKPORT also try CHESHIRE and MANCHESTER.

* Also remember some local radio users will be using national frequencies (the same from area to area) 
so bear in mind the NATIONAL USAGE and UK WIDE Frequencies. This is The Main UK Scanning Directory File 
which is updated often but for the latest daily updated files please see the other listed by frequency files 
in this section on the disc (titled by frequency range and month).
