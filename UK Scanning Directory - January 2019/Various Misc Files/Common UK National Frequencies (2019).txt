What is Simple UK Light?

The PBR Simple UK Light Licence allows customers to use hand-portable or mobile radio equipment anywhere 
within the UK without the need to inform Ofcom. The licence for this service has been designed to allow

As this is a "go-anywhere" type of service, the use of base stations is not permitted unless prior 
authorisation has been obtained from Ofcom. There is no limitation on the number of sites where a 
licensee can use radios covered by the Simple UK Light licence, or on the duration of use at any location.
The maximum permitted effective radiated power of equipment used under this licence is 5 watts. 

Simple UK Light channels are in wide use accross the UK by a wide varied user base including shops,
quarries, private investigators, sporting events, rescue, security and many, many more.
